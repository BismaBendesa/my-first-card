      <p>
        I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things
        simple and automating daily tasks. I also do UI UX Designs. I am new to
        code so please be nice (●__●). Currently I am in my progress pursuing
        Front-End skillset especially in web design. Wish me luck!
